## Setup: ##

This project uses Repo because it is a composite project. There is a defeault.xml in this
repository that is used to actually get this and our crosstool-ng repositories, both of
which are needed to create the build environment and also to
    repo init -u git@git.devops.lairdtech.com:CP_linux/toolchains.git
    repo sync

## Building: ##

To just build all the toolchains:

    make
